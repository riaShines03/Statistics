# Statistics
How Couples Meet and Stay Together is a research study that surveyed how Americans met their spouses and romantic partners,
and compared traditional to nontraditional couples. In this project, you will write a program to analyze data from this research study.

You will write two code modules in two files, as well as a number of unit tests. In stats.cpp, you will write functions that compute basic
statistics like mean and standard deviation. You’ll test your functions using unit tests, which you will add to stats_tests.cpp. Finally, 
write a driver program reads a data file from the study and computes statistics in main.cpp.

This project uses the Standard Template Library (STL) vector which is similar to an array. If you’ve never seen a vector before, check out
Appendix B: vector How-to at the end of this document. Vectors are pretty convenient to use, and the appendix gives examples of exactly how to
use them for this project.
